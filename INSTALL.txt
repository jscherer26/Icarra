Ubuntu
------

Icarra requires the PyQt GUI library.  Ubuntu will install the required libraries using apt-get.  PyQt may also be installed from source in which case two separate libraries must be installed: SIP (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download) and PyQt (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download).

The following commands will install the required libraries:

sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install python-qt

cd icarra2/installed/sgmlop
sudo python setup.py install

cd icarra2/installed/python-jsonrpc
sudo python setup.py install

cd icarra2/installed/feedparser
sudo python setup.py install

cd icarra2/installed/keyring
sudo python setup.py install

Sqlite3 is a useful tool that can be used to view Icarra's databases:

sudo apt-get install sqlite3

Windows
-------

Download and install PyQt from Riverbank computing.  The most recent url is http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download.  You can build from sourec or use the installer.  If you choose to download the installer make sure you pick the correct installer for your version of python.

You must make sure that the PyQt DLLs are in your path.  The command will look like this If you are using the bashs shell under cygwin:

    export PATH="{$PATH}:/cygdrive/c/Python26/Lib/site-packages/PyQt4/bin"

cd icarra2/installed/sgmlop
sudo python setup.py install

cd icarra2/installed/python-jsonrpc
sudo python setup.py install

cd icarra2/installed/feedparser
sudo python setup.py install

cd icarra2/installed/keyring
sudo python setup.py install

OS X
----

It is recommended to not use the python that is bundled with OS X.  The Icarra OS X binary is built using python 2.7 from MacPorts.

Download and install the PyQt and SIP source from Riverbank computing.  The most recent url is http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download.  You must build and install from source.

From the sip directory:

    python2.7 configure.py
    make
    sudo make install

From the qt directory:

    python2.7 configure.py --sipdir=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
    make
    sudo make install

cd icarra2/installed/sgmlop
sudo python2.7 setup.py install

cd icarra2/installed/python-jsonrpc
sudo python2.7 setup.py install

cd icarra2/installed/feedparser
sudo python2.7 setup.py install

cd icarra2/installed/keyring
sudo python2.7 setup.py install
